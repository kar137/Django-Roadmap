# 📘 Django Roadmap

Welcome to my **Django Roadmap** repository! 🌟 This repo outlines my structured learning path for mastering Django, one of the most popular web development frameworks. It includes my goals, weekly progress, and hands-on projects. This roadmap will help me track my development journey and serve as a guide for others looking to follow a similar path.The projects are the part of my learning from Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Python Django - The Practical Guide which is available on udemy, However I have made sure to add some modifications to the projects.

## 💡 **Why This Roadmap?**

This repository was created to provide a clear and organized plan for learning Django. By following this roadmap, I aim to become proficient in developing full-stack web applications and solidify my knowledge of back-end development concepts.
